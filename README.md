# The Data Set
- an e-commerce data set from kaggle was used for this project because it is nice to work with.
- the main goal is to build a platform and pipelines with the data set 

# Used Tools
- kinesis, S3 storage, DynamoDB, Redshift Data warehouse, power BI, Glue.

# Pipelines
- Data ingestion (API, Lambda,Kinesis)
- Stream To Raw S3 Storage
- Visualization API For DynamoDB
- Stream to Redshift
- Batch processing pipeline

# Stream Processing
Firstly lambda function was created for kinesis and also API gateway using resource and methods, configure the API gateway to Lambda function.

# Storing Data Stream
for storing data stream  Kinesis data stream called API DATA was created,IAM was already generated by Lambda.
Data from kinesis was used to trigger lambda function for DynamoDB.
Lambda writes customer data (customer + invoices), (invoices + stockcode).


# Processing Data Stream
S3 bucket and IAM was created for S3, Lambda function was also created to write kinesis to S3.
Kinesis firehose delivery stream connects to kinesis data streams.
Firehouse writes data into intermediate S3 buckets.
Kinesis firehose copies data into Redshift table.

# Batch Processing
a customer and invoice table was created on DynamoDB, an IAM was also created

# Visualizations
Data reset in DynamoDB table invoices.
Client request items for invoiceNo
Lambda triggered by API, queries DynamoDB with InvoiceNO.

# Test
Postman was used for testing
PowerBI
